term designating every p'ainfisl oppressiva feeling. 'Ibe context

tenant to Cu. Pompey, though steiving to obtain aud demauding
(him foruna). 'Ibe case is simply this: Gabinius in his mbuneship
procures the peasage of a law investing Pompey with almost unlimit·
ed power: among other extraordinary granta, allowing him 15 legates
