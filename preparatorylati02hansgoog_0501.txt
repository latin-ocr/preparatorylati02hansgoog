Annalem.

Cn. 1. By way oi introduction‚ Cicero congratulatae the people that

Catilius has leit the city, and can do no more iujury.
· Cu. 11. He admits that Catillus deserved death, aud that precedent re·
quired that he should be punished with death, bnt at the seme time justifies
himself l'or allowing hini to escape, by showing that, lt he had put him to
death, it would have been impossible, in cousequepee of the odium that
would hare hoen heuped upon him by the ineredulous, the ἰςιιοιιιιιι, and
the ticieus, to bring his associatos tojustice;

Cu. III. Thht, from a comparison of the characteres those who com·
posed Catiline's army with that ol' the forces raised hy the authority of the
state, that army was not so much to be leared as tho other conspirators
urere who still mmuincd at Rome ;

Cn. IV. That, as a result ol' Catiline's departure aud of his putting
himself at the head os his army, it was evident that a conspiracy had been
ionued against the government ; that Catilius, while iu the city, nas the
chief source ol' eomuption, especially to the youug;

Cn. V. That the most audacioua aud worthless oi the lowest classes

been the good lomene of the republicae well as the glory of his consul·

and that the only enemy that &me had to sear, aas the enemy within her

Ca. VI. Having, ln the four premding chaphtis, fully vindicated him-
solt hom the charge of too great lenity, cicero ιιοιι prooeeds to ddend
himself against the charge of too grem severity brought agaim him hy
the adherente ol Catilina. This he does, litet, by testing what had nans
pired in the senate the day belore; and, seooudly,

Cn. VII. By showing, from several circumstances, thet Catilina, ιο fat
from having been driven into banishment to Mamuda, had oo mentiones
going thither, hut had actually gone to his army.

, Cu. VIII. To vindicate himsell' still turritanensi to show the extent
ot' the conspiracy and the imminent danger which threatened the common·
wealth, he divides the conspiratura into slx classes. The first classis eom·

posed of those who aru greatly in dobt, and yet might pay their debtsii
they would: these are not greatly to hs secred.
Gn. IX. The mcond class consiste oi tirose who are oserwhelmed with

debu end yet am mining at supreme powerln the state. The third class
are somswhat advaneed lu years, yet among aud rigemus: these too hare,
mmuh umvagance, t'alleu so greatly into deht that their only hope is iu
a reuewal ol the universal plunder aud rapine which existed iu the tlma ol
