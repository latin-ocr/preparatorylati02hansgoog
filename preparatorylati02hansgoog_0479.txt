83, under the following circumstances: 0n the night of the bsh of No-
rember Catilina met the singleadsrs of his adherente attho dwellingof if ·
Porcius Isaeca ; and, after complaining of their baclrwardaaas and inactirity,
informed them that ha had despatched Manlius to Enurie, Septimius of
Ι Camers to Picenum, 0. Julius to Apulia, aad others of less nine to differ·

ant parts of Italy, to raise open war, and to organice a general revolt of tha
slave population. He added, that he was deshous to place himself at the
nereensis troops, eut enar e was enerues amq n ue estpars e
minore Cicero, whose vigilance was mest injurionsto their caasa Upon
this, L. Vargunteius, a senator, and C. Cornelias, a knight, undertook to
- repsir at an early bour the following morningto the honae of tha consul,
to make their way into his chamber, as if for the purpose of paying their
respecta, and then to stab him on the spot 'l'ho whole of these proceed-
ings was instantly reported to their intended rictitn by Fulvia, a dissoluto
woman of high rank, who was on terma of intimacy with Q. Cannaene
of the conspiratura who was present at this nocturnal meeting,by whom
they were immediately communicated to her. The maurina, wben they
presented themselves, found tha house gnarded, and wera refused admis-
sion; and, certain intelligenca haring been now received that the rebellion
had actually broken out on the etth of October, ia Etruria, Cicero, on the
ath of November, went down to tho sanam, which, for greater sscurity, had
been summoned to meet in the temple of Jupiter Stator. The principal
object for which ha had summoned the senate was to lay before them tha
facts which he bad gathered from Fulvia and others, in reference to the
imminent danger thet threatened the commonwealth. Te his atter surprise
and astonishment, be found Catilius present with the otbcr senators; in·
stead, therefore, of proceeding to tha transaction of tha business for which
ha bad called the senata together, he arose and delivered this oration;
which paralysed tha trahor, not so mnch hy the wehemcnce ef the inrec-
tire, aa hythe intimata acquaintance which it displayed with all his most
hidden contricances. Catiline, who upon his entrance had been avoided
byall, and wsa sitting alone upon a bench from which every ons had
shrnnlr, rosa to reply with dosvnraet conntenanoa, and in bombis aeeents
imploncd the fathers not to listen te the malignant calumnier ef an apstart
foreigncr against tha noblest blood in Borne; bnt scarcely badhe corn·
menoed, when his words wera drownerl hy tha sbonts of “enemy '' and
“ parricide,'' which burst from the whole assemhly, aad ha rushed forth
with threats aad carnes on his lips.
