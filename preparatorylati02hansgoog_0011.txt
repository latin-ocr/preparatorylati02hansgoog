Tne preparation of this volume was oommenoed some years
since in the belief that the Latin preparatory oourse for college,
both in the variety aud arrangement of the materiale oomposing
it and in the materiale themselves, could he improved ; and that,
by oompn'sing in a single volume what is usually obtained from

result of my humhie affort shall be to ooli attention to its menits
ond give it a wider circulation, I shall be highly gratified
Besides giving toachers a ehoioe in the use of grammaria, itis
