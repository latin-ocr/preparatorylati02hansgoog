Vi PREFAOE·

year succeeding his consulship and ending with the year oi his
death. Besides throwing much light upon the o'rations and af·
fording to the pupil a pleasing and interesting variety of reading-
matter, these letters rereal more of the heart and true character
of Rome’s greatest orator, philosopher, and scholar, than any
number ol his orations could possibly do. These letters have
been arranged in chronological order, and there has been pre·
fixed to those of each year a brief history in Latin of the prin·
cipal events of that year. This will aid very much in under·
standing many of the allusione in the text I hope this slight
departure from the old beaten track may prove acceptable to
both teachers arrd scholare.

In conclusion, I wish to say that very little is claimed on the
soors of originality. Mine has been the far humbler tasin to
condense and arrange the materiale which have been produced
by others. Ihave had constantly before me the vannus editions
of Caesar, Sallust, and Cicero, which are in common use in the
sohools ol this country, and, in making the notes, hare drawn
heely from these and all other sources within my resch what-
ever was suitedao my purpose In many instances credit bas
beeri given3 and it would have been agreeable to my views and
leelings always todo this; but it was in some cases rery incon·
venient, and in others quite impossible. A large portion of the
notes on Oicero's letters, and all of the Roman history which is
placed at the beginning of each of the years covered by these
letters, have been taken without much alteration from a selection
of OEoero’s letters by T. K. Arnold Besides my indebtedness
in genum to those who have preceded me in this department oi
literary labor, I am under special obligations to the Rev. J. Τ.
Champlin, D. D.‚ President of Waterville Collega, for many very
valuable suggestions.

With this general statement ol the plan and design ol the
work, and of the sources from which ithae been compiled, the
editor offers it to the public in the hope that it may meet with

a lavorable receptior, and prore usesul in promoting the true
interests of mund learning.
